# About The Project
Reddit-Cmd-Tool is a simple command line tool that displays a Reddit post's title, author and url from the Reddit API. Depending on the user's input, this tool will pull the newest reddit posts, posts that are no longer considered in the top 75 of posts, and new posts that have had a vote count change.

## Getting Started
To run this, you will need to have python 3 installed. All libraries used in this program is built into the python 3.0 standard library. 

Simply run the below Main.py file and a library of reddit-api-specific commands will appear for you to choose from.
```
python3 Main.py -h
```
